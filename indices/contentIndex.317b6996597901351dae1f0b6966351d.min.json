You must hurry, for her fate hangs in the balance. Find her at the lake! \n    Rescued her from North of [[Vallaki]] info can be found under Arabel [[Vistani Members]]\n5. Look to the mother’s tomb.\n\n## Dream\n(while sleeping in [[Vallaki#Vistani Camp]] (Post [[Argynvostholt]]))\nYou open your eyes and find yourself sitting by a long table in a fine dining hall. You sit at the far end away from the fireplace. On the other end you can see a man, but you can’t make out who it is. You hear him saying “Same voice, same face, same graceful body, she was Tatyana come back to life again. I was absolutely witless from astonishment.” He lifts his goblet of red liquid and takes a sip from it. You try to say something but to your surprise no sound will come out of your mouth. He puts the goblet back on the table and continues “I had nothing left to give but my own life’s blood, but it was hers to take. She would at last be my bride.” Your vision starts to blur as he stands up and suddenly you are engulfed into mist. \n\n\n[Return to Index](Index)","lastmodified":"2023-04-30T15:14:59.744453461Z","tags":[]},"/Characters/Argynvost":{"title":"Argynvost","content":"Full Name: Argynvost\nAge:\nPlace of Residence: [[Argynvostholt]]\nGender: Male\nRace: Silver Dragon / Human\nHeight:\nWeight:\nDistinguishing Features: Spectral Dragon that can shrink / grow\nClothing Style:\nStrength:\n - \nWeaknesses:\n - Cursed by the beacon ?(working theory)\n\n**Notes:**\n- Leader and founder of the [[Order of the Silver Dragon]]\n- Slain by [[Count Strahd von Zarovich]]\n\n[Return to Index](Index)","lastmodified":"2023-04-30T15:14:59.744453461Z","tags":[]},"/Characters/Count-Strahd-von-Zarovich":{"title":"Count Strahd von Zarovich","content":"Full Name: Strahd von Zarovich\nAge:\nPlace of Residence: [[Ravenloft]]\nGender: Male\nRace: Vampire\nHeight:\nWeight:\nDistinguishing Features:\nClothing Style:\nStrength:\n - \nWeaknesses:\n - Doesn't seem to be able to use his powers on Ireena \n\n**Notes:**\n- Possesses a flaming, flying black horse.\n- Can speak telepathically to PC.\n- Calls the party his toys\n- Knows about Gertruda, information lured out during meeting @ [[Vallaki#Coffinshop]]\n- Says : \"He sees it all, he knows it all.\"\n- Made a deal with Lady Wachter when she was in her teens.\n\n**Related handouts:**\n- [[Strahd's Crest]]\n- [[Strahd's invitation]]\n- [[Strahd's Letter (Found in Durst House)]]\n\n[Return to Index](Index)\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-30T15:14:59.744453461Z","tags":[]},"/Characters/Donavich-Family-Village-of-Barovia":{"title":"Donavich Family (Village of Barovia)","content":"Father: Father Donavich\nSon : Doru (Killed by us)\n\n## Father Donavich\nFull Name: ?
