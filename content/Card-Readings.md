This card tells of history. Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy: __A woman hangs above a roaring fire__. Find her, and you will find the treasure.

This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope:

Your enemy is a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond mortality. This card will lead you to him! I see a secret place, __a vault of temptation hidden behind a woman of great beauty__. The evil waits atop his tower of treasure.

## Madam Eva's reading

1. Look to the one who sees all. The treasure is hidden in her camp.
    [[Artifacts/Tome of Strahd]] found in [[Locations/Vistani - Crossroad Barovia - Vallaki]]
2. The treasure lies in a dragon’s house, in hands once clean and now corrupted.
    Likely within Argynvostholt or the Amber Temple. 
3. An evil tree grows atop a hill of graves where the ancient dead sleep. The ravens can help you find it. Look for the treasure there. Might be [[Locations/Yester Hill]]
4. I see a child—a Vistana. You must hurry, for her fate hangs in the balance. Find her at the lake! 
    Rescued her from North of [[Locations/Vallaki]] info can be found under Arabel [[Characters/Vistani Members#Arabel]]
5. Look to the mother’s tomb.

## Dream
(while sleeping in [[Locations/Vallaki#Vistani Camp]] (Post [[Locations/Argynvostholt]]))
You open your eyes and find yourself sitting by a long table in a fine dining hall. You sit at the far end away from the fireplace. On the other end you can see a man, but you can’t make out who it is. You hear him saying “Same voice, same face, same graceful body, she was Tatyana come back to life again. I was absolutely witless from astonishment.” He lifts his goblet of red liquid and takes a sip from it. You try to say something but to your surprise no sound will come out of your mouth. He puts the goblet back on the table and continues “I had nothing left to give but my own life’s blood, but it was hers to take. She would at last be my bride.” Your vision starts to blur as he stands up and suddenly you are engulfed into mist.
