The _Tome of Strahd_ is an ancient work penned by Strahd, a tragic tale of how he came to his fallen state. The book is bound in a thick leather cover with steel hinges and fastenings. The pages are of parchment and very brittle. Most of the book is written in the curious shorthand that only Strahd employs. Stains and age have made most of the work illegible, but several paragraphs remain intact and readable.

Found in [[Locations/Vistani - Crossroad Barovia - Vallaki]] as per Madam Eva's reading.
