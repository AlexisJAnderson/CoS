She informs us we can buy another big dreampie for 1GP each.
She tells us they're stuffed with all kinds of meat like chicken, goat, deer, wolf depending on the catch.

## 2nd floor
Two ugly women with human leather clothes are dancing, cackeling as they do.
3 crates in cabinet, small door with iron latch and hinges, inside are 2 children (a boy and a girl) very young. They seem concious and afraid.
